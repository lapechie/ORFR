# ORFR-SPS-114

#### SPS 114 - Operational Risk Financial Requirement Modelling

It is a requirement for an RSE (registrable superannuation entity) licensee to maintain adequate financial resources to address operational risk events that may affect its business operations.

APRA does not endorse any particular approach for determining the ORFR target amount. APRA expects that the majority of RSE licensees would determine their ORFR target amount based on a fairly straightforward approach.

There is scope for broad interpretation of the range of impacts that the ORFR target amount aims to cover. It is APRA’s view that the ORFR target amount would be based, at a minimum, on the predicted impact of operational risk events that may have a material impact on the RSE licensee’s business operations. This minimum expectation excludes extreme events that may have a catastrophic impact.
